6G-TWIN will provide the foundation for the design, implementation and validation of an AI-native reference architecture for 6G systems that incorporates Network Digital Twins (NDT) as a core mechanism for the end-to-end, real-time optimisation, management and control of highly dynamic and complex network scenarios.
