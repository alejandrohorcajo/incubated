# dataModel.UrbanPlanning
These data models describe the main entities involved with smart applications 
that deal with urban planning issues. This set of entities is primarily 
associated with the design and regulation of the uses of space that focus on 
the physical form, economic functions, and social impacts of the urban environments
and on the location of different activities within it. When feasible, references 
to existing schema.org entity types and attributes are included. Finally, these 
models have been devised to be as generic as possible, thus allowing to deal 
with different scenarios

- Pedestrian Areas.
